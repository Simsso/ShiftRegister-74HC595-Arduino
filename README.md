# 74LS47 BCD to Seven Segment Display Decoder/Driver Arduino Library
This library allows you to interact with your decoder/driver ICs as objects, and allows for further extensibility.

The **documentation** is coming soon.

An **example** sketch can be found in this repository at [/examples/example/example.ino](https://github.com/shafeenr/BCDDecoderDriver74LS47/blob/master/examples/example/example.ino).
